# Stoplight Coding Challenge - Integration Tests for Docs Component

Create an integration or e2e test for the included docs component that verifies its functionality.

## Instructions

1. Create a Github repository called "Stoplight Coding Challenge" and invite me: [https://github.com/lottamus](https://github.com/lottamus)
2. Clone this repository and push the code to your new repository.
3. Run `yarn` to install all the dependencies.
4. Run `yarn test` to start the simple server and Cypress test runner.
5. Open up `cypress/integration/api-component/sidebar.spec.js` and begin adding tests.

## Requirements

- [ ] ?

## Bonus (not required)

- [ ] Use TypeScript instead of plain JavaScript.
- [ ] There is an alternative layout for Elements that is stacked instead of using a sidebar. All of the same things should be tested, but the page layout is different. How much testing logic should be shared between `sidebar.spec.js` and `stacked-bonus.spec.js` to strike a good balance between readability and maintainability?

## Project Structure
